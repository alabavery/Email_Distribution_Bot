A few things are needed to start using the bot:
1. from the terminal: `mkdir data; cd data; echo '{}' > seen_email_data.json`
2. put your voter file as a list of strings into a file called 'data/unused_voters.json'
3. [Follow the instructions here with the email account you plan to use](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python?authuser=3).
4. from the terminal, in the project directory: `python index.py` and follow the browser prompts that follow.
